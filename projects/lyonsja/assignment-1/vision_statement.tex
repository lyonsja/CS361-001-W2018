	\section{Problem}
	Existing textbook buyback options for students are sorely lacking. With the demise of half.com, 
	there are almost no good options for students. Other buyback programs use predatory pricing tactics 
	that take advantage of students. Although independent options exist (ebay, craigslist, etc.) they are
	generalized marketplaces with no special consideration for students trying to sell books. For example,
	ebay places limits on how many items new sellers can list. For students just trying to sell a few books,
	there are almost no good options.
		


	\section{Solution}

	The solution is to create a new website/app that addresses the issues with existing platforms.
	It will ideally target the college student demographic as a robust, accessible app. Utilizing existing online
        information on textbook prices (Amazon, ebay, etc), it would have fair pricing for students. Ideally it would have
	options for students to connect locally and sell books. Also, it would afford for students to sell books to distant buyers
	as well. The app must allow students to take pictures of their textbooks and make posts to place them on the marketplace.
	Also, a intuitive, yet minimalistic buyer interface, search, and ability to filter by distance, condition, price, etc.

		

	\section{Risks}
	The risks of this implementation are several. Most importantly, marketing could present a significant obstacle.
        Even if the app itself is excellent, it will require a large user base in order to be effective.
